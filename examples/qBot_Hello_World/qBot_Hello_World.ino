/*
 * This is an example sketch for the qBot robot. 
 * Using the qBot PCB entails using a fixed Arduino pinout. The qBot library takes care of this pinout,
 * and also offers some functions in order to interface the various input and output capabilities it has.
 * 
 * ESSENTIAL:
 * Refer to the README.txt document for information on the various functions and variable names where sensor values are stored.
